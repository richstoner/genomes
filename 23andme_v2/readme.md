This file contains raw genotype data, including data that is not used in 23andMe reports. This data has undergone a general quality review however only a subset of markers have been individually validated for accuracy. As such, this data is suitable only for research, educational, and informational use and not for medical or other use.

Below is a text version of your data.  Fields are TAB-separated Each line corresponds to a single SNP. For each SNP, we provide its identifier (an rsid or an internal id), its location on the reference human genome, and the genotype call oriented with respect to the plus strand on the human reference sequence. We are using reference human assembly build 37 (also known as Annotation Release 104). Note that it is possible that data downloaded at different times may be different due to ongoing improvements in our ability to call genotypes. More information about these changes can be found at:
